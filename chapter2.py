""" Remove dups
Write code to remove duplicate from an unsorted linked list
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer isn't allowed ?
"""

""" Return kth to last
Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list
"""

""" Delete middle node
Implement a algorithm to delete a node in the middle (not first nor last) of a single linked list given only access to that node
"""

""" Partition
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater or equal to x.
If x is contained within the list, the value of x the value of x only need to be after the element less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the right partition; it does not need to appear between the left and the right partitions.
Example:
[input] [3, 5, 8, 5, 10, 2, 1] partition 5
[output] [3, 1, 2, 10, 5, 5, 8]
"""

""" Sum Lists
You have two numbers represented by a libnked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
Example:
[7, 1, 6] + [5, 9, 2] => [2, 1, 9]

Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem
Example:
[6, 1 7] + [2, 9, 5] => [9, 1, 2]
"""

""" Palindrome
Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
"""

""" Intersection
Given two singly linked list, determine if the two lists intersect.
Return the intersecting node.
"""

""" Loop detection
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the begining of the loop.
